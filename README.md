# TMDb-Movies-Data-Analysis
In this project, I performed an exploratory analysis on TMDb movies dataset.
The dataset contains information about 10,000 movies obtaned from The Movie Database (TMDb). The dataset provides information about popularity, rating, budget, revenue casts and genres of movies released between 1960-2015.

I made use of python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
